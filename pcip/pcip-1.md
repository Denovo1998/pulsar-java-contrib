# PCIP-1: Distributed RPC framework implemented by the Pulsar client

# Background knowledge

## Request-Reply Synchronize Model

In this model, the client sends a request and waits for a response from the server. The server receives the request, processes it, and sends back a response. This interaction pattern is fundamental in client-server communication and is crucial for synchronous operations where the client needs a response before proceeding.

## Remote Procedure Call (RPC)

RPC allows functions or procedures to be executed on a different machine from the client making the call, as if they were local. This method abstracts the complexities of network communication, allowing developers to focus on the business logic rather than the underlying network details.

The implementation of RPC is usually based on the Request-Reply model. In this case:

- The RPC client plays the role of the requester, calling a remote procedure as if it were sending a request message.
- The RPC server plays the role of the responder, receiving the request, executing the procedure, and returning the result as a reply message.

## Current behavior of sending messages in Pulsar

The current sending behavior of Pulsar is when the message is successfully published, that is, successfully persisted to the storage layer. The MessageId assigned to the published message by the broker is returned.

## Analogies of message flow in RPC and Pulsar

- In Pulsar, producer is equivalent to RPC Client.
- The RPC Client initiates a request like sending a message producer.
- The RPC Server side receives this request as if the consumer receives the message and then carries out customized processing, and finally ACKs the message.
- If this ACK request contains the result returned by the "server side" and is sent to the original producer(RPC Client).
- After receiving the results returned by the consumer(RPC Server), the producer(RPC Client) directly returns the content of the results.

# Motivation

As we knownï¼ŒPulsar's current asynchronous publish-subscribe model serves well for decoupled message distribution, but it lacks a native mechanism for handling synchronous interactions typical of Remote Procedure Calls (RPC).
This request-reply model can greatly enhance the utility of Pulsar. We can then use Pulsar as a distributed RPC Framework. This also improves the fault tolerance of RPC calls.

PIP-371 is also committed to building such a model.

(https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/23143 and https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/23194)

But we need to implement this distributed RPC framework in a way that does not intrude into the pulsar core library. 
Therefore, we need to use two topics, one is the request topic and the other is the reply topic. The client side sends RPC requests to the request topic, the server side receives request message and performs customized processing, and finally sends them to the reply topic. The client receives the reply message and returns.

### Why would we use Pulsar for this RPC call?

Implement RPC using Apache Pulsar. Requests can be sent through a client, received by one or more servers and processed in parallel. Finally, the server returns all processing results after processing, and the client can perform summary and other operations after receiving them.
This proposal to achieve the function is request. Request and existing send function of pulsar can be mixed to same topic. This means that the user can choose, and the call to the server side (consumer) can be asynchronous or synchronous, which is controlled by the user flexibly.
You can directly use Pulsar's own delaying messages, that is, you can execute RPC regularly.
You can directly use Pulsar's own load balancing mechanism.
You can directly use Pulsar's own message consumption throttling mechanism.
You can directly use Pulsar's own expansion and contraction mechanism.
You can directly use Pulsar's own message call tracking, monitoring, and logging mechanisms.

# Goals

## In Scope

- To implement a pulsar-rpc-client similar to pulsar-client, we can encapsulate request request as a `request message` 
  and send it to `request topic`. This is a pulsar topic dedicated to receiving requests.
- Implement a pulsar-rpc-server. Internally, the pulsar consumer is used to monitor and receive the message in the 
  `request topic`, and custom logic processing is supported. Finally, the processed results (including possible 
  error messages) are encapsulated as `reply message` sent to `reply topic`. This is a pulsar topic dedicated to 
  storing request processed results.

## Implementing RPC in Pulsar RPC Framework

1. **pulsar-rpc-client side**
  - **Sending request message to request-topic**: The `pulsar-rpc-client` publishes a message to a `request-topic`. 
    This message includes all necessary data for the `pulsar-rpc-server` to process the request.
  - **Waiting for reply message**: The `pulsar-rpc-client` listens to reply topic. And return to the user for 
    processing, the user can even decide how many reply messages a request has to process successfully.

2. **pulsar-rpc-server side**
  - **Receive and process the request message**: The server side receives the message and performs custom processing.
  - **Send reply message to reply-topic**: Send reply message(it could also be an error message) to reply-topic.

### Handling Timeouts

- The timeout period is set through the pulsar-rpc-client api, which can set a different timeout period for each 
  message. If the timeout period is exceeded, a TimeoutException is returned. And can be returned to the user for 
  the corresponding custom processing.
- There are two cases of timeout. One is that the request task has timed out after the message is normally send 
  to the `request topic`. This situation will allow the consumer to continue processing, but the `pulsar-rpc-client` 
  will be directly returned to the application TimeoutException. When processing each message, the `pulsar-rpc-server` 
  side will obtain the time of initiating the request (or use receivedMsg.getPublishTime()) plus the timeout in the
  message properties. If it is less than or equal to the current time, then do not process and just ACK this message.
- The other is to time out when doing application customization processing on the consumer side. If, after processing, 
  it is checked whether the current is greater than the time to initiate the request plus the timeout in the message 
  properties. If it is greater than then just ACK message, although it has timed out, the message is "discarded", and 
  more importantly, the `pulsar-rpc-server` needs to execution rollback logic(This is defined by the user when they 
  first create the `pulsar-rpc-server`). Because if the status of some data on the business is changed,
  but the request times out, it is considered a call failure and needs to be rollback.

# Detailed Design

## Design & Implementation Details

**Let's take a simple example to see how we can use the new SDK:**
```java
@Test
public void testRpcCall() throws Exception {
    setupTopic("testRpcCall");
    Map<String, Object> requestProducerConfigMap = new HashMap<>();
    requestProducerConfigMap.put("producerName", "requestProducer");
    requestProducerConfigMap.put("messageRoutingMode", MessageRoutingMode.RoundRobinPartition);

    // 1.Create PulsarRpcClient
    rpcClient = createPulsarRpcClient(pulsarClient, requestProducerConfigMap, null, null);

    // 2.Create PulsarRpcServerImpl
    final int defaultEpoch = 1;
    AtomicInteger epoch = new AtomicInteger(defaultEpoch);
    // What do we do when we receive the request message
    requestFunction = request -> {
        epoch.getAndIncrement();
        return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(new TestReply(request.value() + "-----------done"));
    };
    // If the server side is stateful, an error occurs after the server side executes 3-1, and a mechanism for
    // checking and rolling back needs to be provided.
    rollbackFunction = (id, request) -> {
        if (epoch.get() != defaultEpoch) {
            epoch.set(defaultEpoch);
        }
    };
    rpcServer = createPulsarRpcServer(pulsarClient, requestSubBase, requestFunction, rollbackFunction, null);
    ConcurrentHashMap<String, TestReply> resultMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    Map<String, Object> requestMessageConfigMap = new HashMap<>();
    requestMessageConfigMap.put(TypedMessageBuilder.CONF_DISABLE_REPLICATION, true);

    // 3-1.Synchronous Send
    for (int i = 0; i < messageNum; i++) {
        String correlationId = correlationIdSupplier.get();
        TestRequest message = new TestRequest(synchronousMessage + i);
        requestMessageConfigMap.put(TypedMessageBuilder.CONF_EVENT_TIME, System.currentTimeMillis());

        TestReply reply = rpcClient.request(correlationId, message, requestMessageConfigMap);
        resultMap.put(correlationId, reply);
        log.info("[Synchronous] Reply message: {}, KEY: {}", reply.value(), correlationId);
        rpcClient.removeRequest(correlationId);
    }

    // 3-2.Asynchronous Send
    for (int i = 0; i < messageNum; i++) {
        String asyncCorrelationId = correlationIdSupplier.get();
        TestRequest message = new TestRequest(asynchronousMessage + i);
        requestMessageConfigMap.put(TypedMessageBuilder.CONF_EVENT_TIME, System.currentTimeMillis());

        rpcClient.requestAsync(asyncCorrelationId, message).whenComplete((replyMessage, e) -> {
            if (e != null) {
                log.error("error", e);
            } else {
                resultMap.put(asyncCorrelationId, replyMessage);
                log.info("[Asynchronous] Reply message: {}, KEY: {}", replyMessage.value(), asyncCorrelationId);
            }
            rpcClient.removeRequest(asyncCorrelationId);
        });
    }
    Awaitility.await().atMost(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS).until(() -> resultMap.size() == messageNum * 2);
}
```

**3.PulsarRpcServerBuilder:** Builder class for creating instances of {@link PulsarRpcServer}. This class provides
a fluent API to configure the Pulsar RPC server with necessary schemas, topics, subscriptions,

Instances of {@link PulsarRpcServer} are configured to handle RPC requests and replies using Apache Pulsar
as the messaging system. This builder allows you to specify the request and reply topics,
schemas for serialization and deserialization, and other relevant settings.

**4.PulsarRpcServer:** Represents an RPC server that utilizes Apache Pulsar as the messaging layer to handle
request-response cycles in a distributed environment. This server is responsible for
receiving RPC requests, processing them, and sending the corresponding responses back
to the client.

This class integrates tightly with Apache Pulsar's consumer and producer APIs to
receive messages and send replies. It uses a {@link GenericKeyedObjectPool} to manage
a pool of Pulsar producers optimized for sending replies efficiently across different topics.

```java
public interface PulsarRpcServer<T, V> extends AutoCloseable {

    /**
     * Provides a builder to configure and create instances of {@link PulsarRpcServer}.
     *
     * @param requestSchema the schema for serializing and deserializing request messages
     * @param replySchema the schema for serializing and deserializing reply messages
     * @return a builder to configure and instantiate a {@link PulsarRpcServer}
     */
